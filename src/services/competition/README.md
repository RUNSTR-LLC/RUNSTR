## 🔧 Service Details

### EventEligibilityService

**Purpose**: Automatically detect eligible events for completed workouts

**Key Methods**:
- `checkWorkoutEligibility(workout, userTeams)` - Main eligibility detection
- `getSuggestedEvents(workout, userTeams)` - Get top 3 event suggestions
- `enterWorkoutInEvent(workout, event, privateKey)` - Submit workout to event
- `calculateEventEligibility(workout, event)` - Score workout-event compatibility

**Eligibility Scoring**:
- **90-100**: Perfect match (all required data present, exact activity type match)
- **70-89**: Great match (good data completeness, compatible activity type)
- **50-69**: Good match (basic data present, possible activity match)
- **0-49**: Poor match (limited data or activity mismatch)

**Activity Type Matching**:
```typescript
// Direct matches
'running' → 'Running'
'cycling' → 'Cycling'
'walking' → 'Walking', 'Running' (hiking compatibility)
'gym' → 'Strength Training'
'yoga' → 'Yoga'

// Competition type matching
'Fastest Time' → Requires duration + distance
'Longest Distance' → Requires distance data
'Most Calories' → Requires calorie data
'Best Average' → Requires duration + distance
```

**Caching Strategy**:
- 10-minute cache for eligibility results
- Cache key: `{workoutId}_{teamIds}`
- Automatic cache invalidation on team changes

### AutoEntryPrompt Component

4. User can quick-enter or skip suggestions
5. Success/error feedback with appropriate messaging

### useAutoEventEntry Hook

**Purpose**: Integration layer between workout completion and event suggestions

**Key Features**:

  autoCheck: true,
  showPromptDelay: 1000,
  enableNotifications: true,
});
```
