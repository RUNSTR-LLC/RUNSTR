## ‚ö° **Technical Implementation Strategy**

### Database Choice: SQLite with expo-sqlite
```bash
npm install expo-sqlite
```
- Native performance for calculations
- Offline-first architecture
- React Native optimized
- Minimal dependencies

### File Organization (Maintain <500 lines)
```
src/services/database/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workoutDatabase.ts         # Core SQLite operations
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workoutSyncService.ts      # Background sync
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                  # Database documentation

src/services/competition/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workoutMetricsCalculator.ts # Metrics extraction
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ leagueRankingService.ts    # Live rankings
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ eventEligibilityService.ts # Auto-entry logic
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ leagueDataBridge.ts        # Competition parameters
```

### Build on Existing Systems
- ‚úÖ **CaptainDetectionService**: Already implemented, just integrate UI
- ‚úÖ **Competition Wizards**: Already capture parameters, connect to calculations
- ‚úÖ **NostrWorkoutService**: Already fetches data, enhance with SQLite storage
- ‚úÖ **Team Components**: Already structured, transform static ‚Üí dynamic

### Performance Targets
- **Sub-100ms**: Leaderboard calculations from local SQLite
- **<2s**: Background sync of new workout data
- **Real-time**: UI updates when new workouts detected
- **Progressive**: Load essential data first, details on-demand

---

## üéØ **Implementation Order & Dependencies**

**Week 1**: SQLite foundation (enables everything else)
**Week 2**: Captain UI (depends on existing detection service)
**Week 3**: League rankings (depends on SQLite + metrics)
**Week 4**: Event integration (depends on all previous phases)

### Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ **<100ms** leaderboard updates from local data
- ‚úÖ **Zero friction** workout-to-event submissions
- ‚úÖ **Clear visual distinction** captain vs member UI
- ‚úÖ **Accurate calculations** from 1301 event data
- ‚úÖ **Real-time updates** as team members complete workouts

### Risk Mitigation
- **SQLite Performance**: Index competition_id, npub columns for fast queries
- **Data Consistency**: Implement robust sync error handling and retry logic
- **UI Complexity**: Progressive enhancement - start with basic rankings, add features
- **Competition Logic**: Extensive testing with different wizard configurations
