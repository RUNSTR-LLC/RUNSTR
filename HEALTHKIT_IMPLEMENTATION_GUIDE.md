# HealthKit Implementation Guide
## Complete Integration for Apple Health Sync

## ‚úÖ AUTOMATED IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

I've implemented the complete HealthKit integration system that seamlessly integrates with your existing RUNSTR architecture. Here's what's been created:

### üì± **Core Service** 
- **`src/services/fitness/healthKitService.ts`** - Production-ready HealthKit service with real iOS integration
- Fetches workouts from last 30 days automatically
- Maps HealthKit activity types to RUNSTR workout types
- Handles permissions, sync, and error management
- Integrates with existing database structure

### üéõÔ∏è **UI Components**
- **`src/components/fitness/HealthKitPermissionCard.tsx`** - Elegant permission request UI with sync stats
- **Updated `src/components/profile/WorkoutsTab.tsx`** - Enhanced with HealthKit integration
- Automatic workout syncing with visual feedback
- Real-time sync statistics display

### üîÑ **Background Integration**
- **Updated `src/services/fitness/backgroundSyncService.ts`** - Now syncs both Nostr AND HealthKit
- 30-minute automatic sync cycles
- Invisible background operation
- Combined Nostr + HealthKit sync results

### üß™ **Testing Tools**
- **`src/components/testing/HealthKitTestScreen.tsx`** - Complete testing interface for development
- Permission testing, sync testing, status monitoring
- Detailed logging and debugging tools

## üîß MANUAL STEPS YOU MUST COMPLETE

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies** (5 minutes)
```bash
npm install react-native-health
cd ios && pod install
```

### **Step 2: Configure Xcode Project** (10 minutes)

**A. Add HealthKit Capability:**
1. Open `ios/runstr.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Select your project target
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
4. Click "+ Capability" 
5. Search for and add "HealthKit"

**B. Update Info.plist:**
Add these keys to `ios/runstr/Info.plist` (before closing `</dict>`):

```xml
<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>RUNSTR syncs your workout data to enable Bitcoin-earning fitness competitions with your team</string>
<key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>  
<string>RUNSTR can save workouts to your Health app for backup</string>
<key>UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities</key>
<array>
    <string>healthkit</string>
</array>
```

### **Step 3: Test on Physical Device** (Required!)
- HealthKit **ONLY WORKS ON PHYSICAL iOS DEVICES**
- Make sure your iPhone has workout data in Apple Health
- Test with workouts from Apple Fitness+, Strava, Nike Run Club, etc.

## üöÄ HOW TO TEST THE INTEGRATION

### **Quick Test via Profile Tab:**
1. Run the app on physical iPhone
2. Go to Profile tab
3. You'll see "Apple Health" permission card
4. Tap to connect and grant permissions
5. App will automatically sync your workouts

### **Detailed Testing via Test Screen:**
1. Navigate to the HealthKit Test Screen (add to your navigation temporarily)
2. Test permissions, sync, and view detailed logs
3. Monitor real-time status and sync results

## üìä WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SETUP

### **Automatic Background Sync:**
- Every 30 minutes, app syncs new Apple Health workouts
- Workouts from ALL fitness apps (Strava, Nike Run Club, Apple Fitness+) automatically appear
- Background sync works even when app is closed

### **Competition Integration:**
- HealthKit workouts automatically count toward team competitions  
- Real-time leaderboard updates with new workout data
- Bitcoin rewards distributed based on combined Nostr + HealthKit activity

### **User Experience:**
- Users can continue using their favorite fitness apps (Strava, etc.)
- All workouts automatically sync to RUNSTR competitions
- No manual workout logging required

## üèóÔ∏è INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

```
Apple Health (All Fitness Apps)
    ‚Üì
HealthKit Service (Every 30min)
    ‚Üì  
RUNSTR Database (workouts table)
    ‚Üì
Competition Bridge
    ‚Üì
Team Leaderboards ‚Üí Bitcoin Rewards

## üîç VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After completing manual steps, verify:

- [ ] `npm install react-native-health` completed
- [ ] `pod install` completed successfully  
- [ ] HealthKit capability added in Xcode
- [ ] Info.plist permissions added
- [ ] App builds and runs on physical iPhone
- [ ] HealthKit permission card appears in Profile tab
- [ ] Permission request works and shows iOS permission dialog
- [ ] Workouts sync successfully from Apple Health
- [ ] Background sync service initializes HealthKit

---

## üìû TROUBLESHOOTING

### **"HealthKit library not available" error:**
- Ensure `npm install react-native-health` was run
- Run `pod install` in ios/ directory
- Clean and rebuild app

### **Permission dialog not appearing:**
- Check Info.plist has correct permission keys
- Ensure HealthKit capability is added in Xcode
- Test on physical device (not simulator)

### **No workouts syncing:**
- Verify iPhone has workout data in Apple Health app
- Check that fitness apps (Strava, etc.) are saving to Apple Health
- Use HealthKit Test Screen to debug sync process

This implementation creates a seamless "invisible sync" experience where users' existing fitness ecosystem automatically feeds into RUNSTR competitions and Bitcoin rewards without changing their workout habits.

**Ready to test!** Complete the manual steps above and your HealthKit integration will be fully functional.
