# RUNSTR Onboarding User Flow

## Overview
New users go through a 6-step onboarding process that sets up their profile, wallet, sync preferences, and prepares them for team participation. After onboarding, they're routed to either team creation (Captains) or team discovery (Members).

## Step-by-Step Flow

**Options**:

**For Apple/Google Users**:
- Manual profile creation
- Upload profile picture (optional)
- Enter username (required, 3-30 chars)
- Enter bio (optional, max 150 chars)

### Step 4: Wallet Setup

**For Nostr Users**:

- Strava S (Strava activities)
- Fitbit ‚óè‚óè (Fitbit workouts)

**Manual Sync Info**:

## Technical Requirements

### Database State
- **ZERO mock data** - completely clean database
- No sample teams, users, or activities
- First real user will create first real team

### Authentication States
- Store user login method (apple/google/nostr)
- Track onboarding completion status
- Persist role selection (member/captain)
- Save wallet setup status and type

### Wallet Integration
- **Nostr**: Query profile for lightning address
- **Apple/Google**: Create CoinOS wallet via API
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback for failed wallet creation

### Sync Permissions
- Request actual device permissions when users select sync sources
- Handle permission denials gracefully
- Default to manual sync if all auto-sync fails

### Navigation Flow
- Single linear flow - no back buttons until after Step 2
- Clear progress indication (Step X of 6)
- Dynamic routing based on user choices

### UI Requirements  
- **Dynamic status bar time** - remove hardcoded values
- Match HTML mockup styling exactly
- Responsive to different screen sizes
- Loading states for async operations
- Error states with retry options

## Edge Cases

### Failed Wallet Creation
- Show error message
- Allow user to continue without wallet
- Prompt wallet creation later in profile

### Permission Denials
- HealthKit/notification permissions denied
- Fall back to manual sync/settings toggle
- Don't block onboarding completion

### Network Issues
- Offline onboarding support where possible
- Retry mechanisms for API calls
- Clear error messaging

## Success Metrics
- Onboarding completion rate
- Time to complete onboarding
- Wallet setup success rate  
- Sync source adoption rates
- Captain vs Member selection ratios
