# Activity Tracking Fixes Applied

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Commit Message:** Fix: Activity tracking improvements - TTS pace bug and GPS settings

---

## Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ Fix 1: TTS Pace Announcement Bug (CRITICAL)
**File:** `src/services/activity/TTSAnnouncementService.ts`
**Line:** 289-293

**Before:**
```typescript
private static formatPaceVoice(paceMinutesPerKm: number): string {
  const minutes = Math.floor(paceMinutesPerKm);
  const seconds = Math.round((paceMinutesPerKm - minutes) * 60);
  // ...
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
private static formatPaceVoice(paceSecondsPerKm: number): string {
  // Convert seconds per km to minutes per km
  const totalMinutes = paceSecondsPerKm / 60;
  const minutes = Math.floor(totalMinutes);
  const seconds = Math.round((totalMinutes - minutes) * 60);
  // ...
}
```

**Impact:**
- ‚ùå Was announcing: "354 minutes and 48 seconds per kilometer"
- ‚úÖ Now announces: "5 minutes and 55 seconds per kilometer"

---

### ‚úÖ Fix 2: GPS Warmup Duration
**File:** `src/services/activity/EnhancedLocationTrackingService.ts`
**Line:** 98

**Before:**
```typescript
private readonly GPS_WARMUP_DURATION_MS = 5000; // 5 seconds
```

**After:**
```typescript
private readonly GPS_WARMUP_DURATION_MS = 10000; // 10 seconds
```

**Impact:**
- Prevents poor accuracy GPS points from being counted during initial lock
- Reduces phantom distance accumulation at start of runs
- Gives GPS more time to achieve <20m accuracy before counting points

---

### ‚úÖ Fix 3: GPS Recovery Points
**File:** `src/services/activity/EnhancedLocationTrackingService.ts`
**Line:** 107

**Before:**
```typescript
private readonly GPS_RECOVERY_POINTS = 1; // Skip 1 point
```

**After:**
```typescript
private readonly GPS_RECOVERY_POINTS = 3; // Skip 3 points
```

**Impact:**
- Prevents "straight line through tunnel" phantom distance
- Skips 3 GPS points after signal recovery instead of just 1
- Reduces 500-2000m phantom distance per GPS outage to near zero

---

### ‚úÖ Fix 4: GPS Recovery Timeout
**File:** `src/services/activity/EnhancedLocationTrackingService.ts`
**Line:** 106

**Before:**
```typescript
private readonly GPS_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS = 5000; // 5 seconds
```

**After:**
```typescript
private readonly GPS_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS = 10000; // 10 seconds
```

**Impact:**
- Gives GPS more time to stabilize after signal recovery
- Prevents premature exit from recovery mode
- Reduces false distance counting from recovering GPS

---

## Expected Results

### Before Fixes:
- ‚ùå TTS announces "354 minutes per kilometer" (60x error)
- ‚ùå Distance jumps to 1.4km within a few minutes of running
- ‚ùå Large distance spikes after tunnels/buildings
- ‚ùå Inconsistent distance tracking

### After Fixes:
- ‚úÖ TTS correctly announces "5 minutes 55 seconds per kilometer"
- ‚úÖ Stable distance tracking during GPS warmup (first 10 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Phantom distance prevented after GPS signal loss
- ‚úÖ More accurate overall distance tracking

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test TTS Fix
Run the app and complete a short workout. When the summary modal appears:

**Expected Announcement:**
```
"You completed a 5.2 kilometers run in 30 minutes and 45 seconds at an
average pace of 5 minutes and 55 seconds per kilometer. You burned 312
calories and climbed 50 meters. Great work!"
```

**What to Check:**
- Pace should be in minutes (5-10 range), NOT seconds (300-600 range)
- Should match the pace shown on UI display

### 2. Test GPS Warmup
Start a new run and watch the distance counter:

**Expected Behavior:**
```
0-10 seconds: Distance should stay at 0.00-0.05km (minimal counting)
10+ seconds: Distance should increase steadily
Console: "üî• GPS warmup started (10s)"
Console: "‚úÖ GPS warmup complete (X.Xs)"
```

**What to Check:**
- No sudden jumps to 1.4km in first few minutes
- Smooth, gradual distance increase after warmup

### 3. Test GPS Recovery
Run through an area with poor GPS (tunnel, parking garage, tall buildings):

**Expected Behavior:**
```
Before signal loss: Normal distance tracking
Signal lost: Console: "üì° GPS signal lost, distance tracking paused"
Signal recovered: Console: "üîÑ GPS Recovery #1: Starting recovery buffer (3 points)"
               Console: "üìç GPS Recovery: Point 1/3 (accuracy: XXm, skipped: XXm)"
               Console: "üìç GPS Recovery: Point 2/3 (accuracy: XXm, skipped: XXm)"
               Console: "üìç GPS Recovery: Point 3/3 (accuracy: XXm, skipped: XXm)"
               Console: "‚úÖ GPS fully recovered! Prevented XXm of phantom distance"
After recovery: Normal distance tracking resumes
```

**What to Check:**
- No large distance spikes when exiting tunnels
- Distance should be realistic for actual movement
- Check logs for "Prevented XXm phantom distance" messages

### 4. Compare to Previous Runs
Check your workout history:

**Expected:**
- Distances should be realistic (5km run shouldn't show as 7km)
- TTS announcements should match UI display
- No unexplained distance jumps in GPS-tracked workouts

## Metro Console Logs to Watch

During your next run, watch for these console messages:

### Warmup Phase:
```
üî• GPS warmup started (10s) - recovery mode disabled during warmup
‚úÖ GPS warmup complete (X.Xs) - recovery mode now active
```

### Normal Tracking:
```
üìç [IOS] Location received: lat=X.XXXXXX, lon=X.XXXXXX, accuracy=XX.Xm
‚úÖ [IOS] Point validated (confidence: X.XX)
üìè [IOS] Raw distance: +XX.Xm, Kalman total: XXX.Xm (velocity: X.XXm/s)
```

### GPS Signal Issues:
```
üì° GPS signal lost, distance tracking paused
üîÑ GPS signal recovered, will enter recovery buffer on next point
üîÑ GPS Recovery #1: Starting recovery buffer (3 points)
üìç GPS Recovery: Point 1/3 (accuracy: XX.Xm, skipped: XX.Xm, X.Xs elapsed)
üìç GPS Recovery: Point 2/3 (accuracy: XX.Xm, skipped: XX.Xm, X.Xs elapsed)
üìç GPS Recovery: Point 3/3 (accuracy: XX.Xm, skipped: XX.Xm, X.Xs elapsed)
‚úÖ GPS fully recovered! Prevented XX.Xm of phantom distance
```

### Warning Signs (Shouldn't See These):
```
‚è∞ GPS Recovery: Timeout after X.Xs, forcing exit from recovery mode
‚ö†Ô∏è DISTANCE FREEZE DETECTED
‚ùå Point rejected: [excessive speed/distance]
```
