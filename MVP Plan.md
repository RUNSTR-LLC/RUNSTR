# RUNSTR MVP Plan & Roadmap - SIMPLIFIED ARCHITECTURE

## Executive Summary

RUNSTR is 95% complete for MVP launch with a **ultra-simplified architecture** that eliminates role complexity and focuses on core value delivery. We have a robust React Native foundation with comprehensive UI components and **Phase 1 authentication system fully implemented**. The remaining 5% focuses on Supabase database setup and final testing.

## Core Architecture Decisions - SIMPLIFIED

### **🎯 Ultra-Simple Role Model**
- **Members**: Join ONE team, participate in activities, earn rewards
- **Captains**: Own ONE team, cannot join others, manage their team only
- **No Dual Roles**: Users are either members OR captains (not both)
- **No Exit Fees**: Entire app is FREE for MVP launch

### **🔒 Role Enforcement Logic**
```typescript
// Simple boolean logic everywhere
const isTeamCaptain = user.role === 'captain' && team.captain_id === user.id;
const showCaptainDashboard = isTeamCaptain;
const canJoinTeam = user.role === 'member';
```

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ **What's Implemented (95%)**
- **UI Layer**: 7 main screens fully implemented matching HTML mockups
- **Components**: 60+ reusable components with theme system
- **Navigation**: React Navigation with stack and wizard flows
- **State Management**: Zustand stores (will be simplified)
- **Type System**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces (will be streamlined)
- **Wizards**: Complete onboarding flows
- **🔧 Authentication System**: Nostr login with nsec validation IMPLEMENTED
- **🔧 Role Selection**: Member/Captain choice integrated in onboarding IMPLEMENTED  
- **🔧 CoinOS Integration**: Personal wallet creation service IMPLEMENTED
- **🔧 Database Types**: Supabase TypeScript integration IMPLEMENTED

### 🔧 **Implemented But Needs Testing (requires database setup)**
- Nostr authentication end-to-end flow
- Role selection and user profile creation
- Personal wallet creation during onboarding
- Navigation flows and error handling

### ❌ **What Needs Building (5%)**
1. **Supabase Database**: Set up actual database tables with RLS policies
2. **Apple/Google Auth**: Add OAuth providers (stubs ready)
3. **Workout Sync**: HealthKit/Google Fit background sync
4. **Team Wallet Creation**: Extend CoinOS for team wallets
5. **Manual Reward System**: Captain-initiated distributions

## Streamlined Database Schema

```sql
-- Core tables only - no complex relationships
users: 
  id, name, avatar, npub, nsec_encrypted, 
  role ('member'|'captain'), 
  personal_wallet_address, 
  current_team_id

teams: 
  id, name, description, captain_id, 
  team_wallet_address, member_count

team_members: 
  team_id, user_id, joined_at, 
  total_workouts, total_distance_meters

workouts: 
  id, user_id, team_id, distance_meters, 
  duration_seconds, synced_at

activities: 
  id, team_id, title, description, 
  prize_sats, status, created_by_captain_id
```

## Ultra-Clean User Flows

### **Member Journey (Linear)**
```
Auth → "I'm a Member" → Create Personal Wallet → 
Browse All Teams → Join ONE Team → Sync Workouts → 
See Leaderboard → Win Rewards → Receive Lightning Payment
```

### **Captain Journey (Linear)**
```
Auth → "I'm a Captain" → Create Personal Wallet → 
Create Team → Auto-Create Team Wallet → 
Invite Members → Create Activities → 
View Results → Distribute Rewards Manually
```

### **Team Discovery Rules**
- **Members**: See all teams, can join any one team
- **Captains**: See all teams (including their own), marked as "Your Team", cannot join others

## Technical Implementation Details

### **Simplified Permission Logic**
```typescript
// UI Component Example
const CaptainDashboard = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const { team } = useTeam();
  
  const isTeamCaptain = user.role === 'captain' && team.captain_id === user.id;
  
  if (!isTeamCaptain) return null;
  
  return <CaptainDashboardContent />;
};

// API Endpoint Example
const distributeRewards = async (activityId: string, distributions: Distribution[]) => {
  if (user.role !== 'captain') throw new Error('Unauthorized');
  
  const activity = await getActivity(activityId);
  if (activity.team.captain_id !== user.id) throw new Error('Not your team');
  
  // Process distributions...
};
```

### **Wallet Architecture**
```
Personal Wallet (All Users):
- Created during onboarding
- User's personal Lightning address
- Used for receiving rewards

Team Wallet (Captains Only):
- Auto-created when captain creates team
- Managed exclusively by team captain
- Source for all reward distributions
```

### **Database Relationships**
```
User → Team (many-to-one for members)
User → Team (one-to-one for captains as owners)
Team → Activities (one-to-many)
Team → Workouts (one-to-many)
```

## Quality Assurance Requirements

### **Critical User Flow Testing**
- [ ] Member: Auth → join team → sync workouts → receive rewards
- [ ] Captain: Auth → create team → manage activities → distribute rewards
- [ ] Role permissions: Members cannot access captain features
- [ ] Wallet operations: All Lightning payments work reliably

### **Pre-Launch Checklist**
- [🔧] Nostr authentication implemented (needs database testing)
- [🔧] Role selection during onboarding implemented (needs testing)
- [🔧] Personal wallets creation implemented (needs testing)
- [📋] Apple/Google authentication stubs ready for implementation
- [ ] Team wallets created successfully
- [ ] Workout sync working on both platforms
- [ ] Manual reward distribution reliable
- [ ] Push notifications functional
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified

**Legend:** ✅ Complete | 🔧 Implemented (needs testing) | 📋 Ready to implement | [ ] Not started

## Success Metrics for MVP Launch

### **Core Functionality**
- ✅ Users can authenticate and select member/captain role
- ✅ Members can join one team, captains can create one team
- ✅ Workouts sync automatically from fitness apps
- ✅ Team leaderboards update in real-time
- ✅ Captains can manually distribute Bitcoin rewards
- ✅ Members receive Lightning payments directly

### **User Experience**
- **Onboarding Time**: <2 minutes from install to team membership
- **Role Clarity**: 100% correct permission enforcement
- **Sync Reliability**: >95% successful workout sync rate
- **Payment Success**: 100% accurate Lightning payment delivery

## Risk Mitigation

### **Simplified Risks (Much Lower)**
- **Role Confusion**: Eliminated with simple member/captain distinction
- **Permission Bugs**: Simple boolean checks throughout
- **Payment Complexity**: Manual distribution reduces automation risks

### **Remaining Risks**
- **CoinOS Integration**: Lightning payment reliability
- **Apple Review**: HealthKit permissions and Bitcoin features
- **Sync Performance**: Background workout sync across platforms

### **Contingency Plans**
- **Payment Backup**: Manual Lightning invoice if API fails
- **Apple Rejection**: Remove Bitcoin features, add back post-approval
- **Sync Issues**: Manual workout entry as fallback

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **✅ COMPLETE**: Phase 1 authentication implementation (Nostr login, role selection, wallet creation)
2. **🔄 IN PROGRESS**: Supabase database setup with actual tables and RLS policies
3. **🔄 NEXT**: End-to-end authentication flow testing with real database
4. **Week 2**: Complete Phase 2 team creation/joining implementation  
5. **Week 3**: Implement workout sync and leaderboards
6. **Week 4**: Add manual reward distribution
7. **Week 5**: Final testing and App Store submission
