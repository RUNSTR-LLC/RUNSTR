# Amber Integration for RUNSTR

## Overview
Amber login has been successfully integrated into RUNSTR, providing secure Nostr authentication for Android users where private keys never leave the Amber app.

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created:
1. **AmberNDKSigner.ts** - NDK Signer implementation for Amber
   - Implements NDKSigner interface
   - Handles deep linking callbacks
   - Manages signing, encryption, and decryption operations

2. **amberAuthProvider.ts** - Authentication provider for Amber
   - Checks Amber installation
   - Manages authentication flow
   - Integrates with existing auth system

### Files Modified:
1. **LoginScreen.tsx** - Added Amber login UI
   - Shows "Login with Amber" button below nsec input
   - Only visible on Android devices
   - Detects if Amber is installed

2. **AuthContext.tsx** - Added `signInWithAmber` method
   - Seamless integration with existing auth flow
   - Caches user profile data
   - Handles session persistence

3. **AuthService.ts** - Added Amber authentication method
   - Parallel to existing nsec and Apple auth
   - Validates Amber availability
   - Returns standardized auth result

4. **app.json** - Configured deep linking
   - Added Android intent filters
   - Configured `runstrproject://amber-callback` URL scheme

5. **nutzapService.ts** - Added receive-only mode
   - Allows Amber users to receive zaps
   - No wallet management without nsec access

## User Experience

### Login Flow:
1. User taps "Sign in with Nostr"
2. Sees nsec input field with "OR" divider below
3. Android users see amber-colored "Login with Amber" button
4. Tapping button opens Amber app
5. User approves permissions in Amber
6. Returns to RUNSTR authenticated

### Features:
- **Secure**: Private keys never leave Amber
- **Simple**: One-tap authentication
- **Persistent**: Auto-reconnects on app restart
- **Compatible**: Works alongside existing nsec login

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. Android device (physical or emulator)
2. Amber app installed from Play Store

### Testing Steps:
1. Build and run the app:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --ios  # For Metro bundler
   # Then open Xcode and run on Android device
   ```

2. Navigate to login screen
3. Tap "Sign in with Nostr"
4. Verify "Login with Amber" button appears (Android only)
5. Tap Amber button
6. Approve permissions in Amber app
7. Verify successful authentication
8. Check that profile loads correctly
9. Test creating workout events
10. Force quit app and reopen to test session persistence

### Expected Behavior:
- iOS devices: No Amber option shown
- Android without Amber: Shows "Install Amber" button
- Android with Amber: Shows "Login with Amber" button
- After auth: User profile and workouts load normally
- Event signing: All Nostr events signed through Amber

## Technical Details

### Deep Linking:
- Scheme: `runstrproject://amber-callback`
- Handles callbacks with request ID tracking
- 60-second timeout for auth requests
- 30-second timeout for signing requests

### Security:
- No private keys stored in app
- All cryptographic operations through Amber
- Secure intent-based communication
- Public key cached for session persistence

### Compatibility:
- NDK-only implementation (no nostr-tools)
- Works with existing AuthContext
- Supports all required event kinds (0, 1, 1301, 30000, 33404)
- NIP-04 encryption/decryption support

## Known Limitations:
1. Android-only (Amber not available on iOS)
2. NutZap wallet creation requires nsec (receive-only for Amber users)
3. User must have Amber installed first
4. Requires user interaction for each signing operation

## Future Enhancements:
1. Background event signing queue
2. Batch signing support
3. NIP-44 encryption when Amber supports it
4. Wallet management integration when available

## Troubleshooting History

### Issue #1: Kind 1/1301 Events Fail to Sign (January 2025)

**Symptom:**
- User tries to post kind 1 (social) or kind 1301 (workout) event
- Error message appears immediately
- Amber app never pulls up for signing
- Login with Amber works perfectly

**Root Cause:**
The `AmberNDKSigner` was created successfully during login, but was **never attached to the GlobalNDK instance**. When services tried to sign events:
1. `UnifiedSigningService.getSigner()` created an AmberNDKSigner
2. Signer was cached locally in UnifiedSigningService
3. BUT: `ndk.signer` on GlobalNDK remained undefined
4. Services using GlobalNDK directly couldn't sign (no signer)
5. Error occurred before Amber was called

**Affected Code Paths:**
- Workout posting (`WorkoutPublishingService`)
- Social posts (kind 1 events)
- Team join requests (`joinRequestPublisher`)
- Any Nostr event creation

**Solution (Commit 248e2d5):**
Set the signer on GlobalNDK immediately after creating it:

```typescript
// UnifiedSigningService.ts
if (authMethod === 'amber') {
  const signer = new AmberNDKSigner();
  await signer.blockUntilReady();

  this.cachedSigner = signer;

  // CRITICAL FIX: Set signer on GlobalNDK
  const ndk = await GlobalNDKService.getInstance();
  ndk.signer = signer;

  console.log('✅ UnifiedSigningService: Created AmberNDKSigner and set on GlobalNDK');
  return signer;
}
```

**Testing:**
- ✅ Login with Amber
- ✅ Try posting a workout (kind 1301)
- ✅ Verify Amber pulls up with signing request
- ✅ Approve in Amber
- ✅ Event posts successfully

---

### Issue #2: Join Requests Bypass GlobalNDK (January 2025)

**Symptom:**
- Team join requests silently fail for Amber users
- No error message, just nothing happens
- Works fine for nsec users

**Root Cause:**
`joinRequestPublisher.ts` created its own `NostrRelayManager()` instance, which internally created a fresh NDK instance without the Amber signer set on GlobalNDK.

```typescript
// OLD CODE (broken):
const relayManager = new NostrRelayManager(); // New NDK, no signer
const publishResult = await relayManager.publishEvent(signedEvent);
```

**Solution (Commit 3faead6):**
Use `GlobalNDKService` instead, which has the signer properly set:

```typescript
// NEW CODE (fixed):
const signingService = UnifiedSigningService.getInstance();
const signature = await signingService.signEvent(eventTemplate);
const signedEvent = { ...eventTemplate, sig: signature };

const ndk = await GlobalNDKService.getInstance(); // Has signer
const ndkEvent = new NDKEvent(ndk, signedEvent);
await ndkEvent.publish();
```

**Testing:**
- ✅ Login with Amber
- ✅ Browse teams
- ✅ Request to join a team
- ✅ Verify Amber pulls up for signing
- ✅ Approve request in Amber
- ✅ Join request appears in captain's dashboard

---

### Issue #3: nostr-tools Crypto Initialization Conflicts (January 2025)

**Symptom:**
- Random crypto errors during signing
- "Cannot initialize crypto module" errors
- Intermittent failures

**Root Cause:**
`NostrProtocolHandler.ts` and `AmberNDKSigner.ts` imported functions from `nostr-tools` at the top level, mixing with NDK's crypto. Per CLAUDE.md: "NEVER use nostr-tools in wallet code - Use NDK exclusively."

```typescript
// OLD CODE (broken):
import { generateSecretKey, getPublicKey, finalizeEvent, verifyEvent, nip19 } from 'nostr-tools';
```

**Solution (Commit 3faead6):**
1. Use NDK's built-in `nip19` instead of nostr-tools
2. Dynamic imports for legacy nostr-tools functions only when needed
3. Removed all top-level nostr-tools imports

```typescript
// NEW CODE (fixed):
import { nip19 } from '@nostr-dev-kit/ndk'; // Use NDK's nip19

// Dynamic imports only when necessary:
const { finalizeEvent } = await import('nostr-tools');
```

**Files Fixed:**
- `NostrProtocolHandler.ts`
- `AmberNDKSigner.ts`

**Testing:**
- ✅ Sign multiple events in succession
- ✅ Watch for crypto initialization errors
- ✅ Verify consistent signing behavior

---

### Issue #4: Amber Requests Hang Indefinitely (January 2025)

**Symptom:**
- User taps action that requires Amber signing
- Amber app opens
- User gets distracted, doesn't approve
- RUNSTR app hangs forever waiting for response

**Root Cause:**
`IntentLauncher.startActivityAsync()` has no built-in timeout. If user never responds in Amber, the Promise never resolves.

**Solution (Commit 3faead6):**
Wrap all Intent launches in a timeout using `Promise.race()`:

```typescript
private async startActivityWithTimeout(
  action: string,
  options: any,
  timeoutMs: number = 60000 // 60 seconds
): Promise<any> {
  return Promise.race([
    IntentLauncher.startActivityAsync(action, options),
    new Promise((_, reject) =>
      setTimeout(
        () => reject(new Error(`Amber request timed out after ${timeoutMs / 1000} seconds`)),
        timeoutMs
      )
    )
  ]);
}
```

**Testing:**
- ✅ Trigger signing action
- ✅ Open Amber but don't approve
- ✅ Wait 60 seconds
- ✅ Verify timeout error appears
- ✅ User can retry without force-quitting app

---

### Issue #5: Amber Not Installed - Confusing Errors (January 2025)

**Symptom:**
- User tries to sign with Amber
- Generic error: "Could not get public key from Amber: Unknown error"
- No guidance to install Amber

**Root Cause:**
`IntentLauncher` throws generic errors when no app can handle the Intent. No detection of "Amber not installed" scenario.

**Solution (Commit 3faead6):**
Enhanced error detection in `startActivityWithTimeout()`:

```typescript
catch (error) {
  const errorMessage = String(error);

  if (errorMessage.includes('No Activity found') ||
      errorMessage.includes('ActivityNotFoundException') ||
      errorMessage.includes('No app can perform this action')) {
    throw new Error(
      'Amber app not found. Please install Amber from Google Play Store:\n' +
      'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greenart7c3.nostrsigner'
    );
  }

  throw error;
}
```

**Testing:**
- ❌ Uninstall Amber from test device
- ✅ Try to login with Amber
- ✅ Verify helpful error message with Play Store link

---

### Issue #6: Poor Error Messages for Amber Failures (January 2025)

**Symptom:**
- Amber signing fails for various reasons (timeout, rejection, crash)
- Generic error: "Amber signing failed: Unknown error"
- User doesn't know what went wrong or how to fix it

**Solution (Commit 3faead6):**
Enhanced error handling in `UnifiedSigningService.signEvent()`:

```typescript
if (authMethod === 'amber') {
  const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error);

  // User rejected/canceled
  if (errorMessage.includes('rejected') || errorMessage.includes('canceled')) {
    throw new Error('Signing request rejected in Amber. Please approve the request...');
  }

  // Amber not installed
  if (errorMessage.includes('not found') || errorMessage.includes('ActivityNotFoundException')) {
    throw new Error('Could not connect to Amber. Please ensure Amber is installed...');
  }

  // Timeout
  if (errorMessage.includes('timeout') || errorMessage.includes('timed out')) {
    throw new Error('Amber response timed out. Please try again and respond promptly...');
  }

  // Permission denied
  if (errorMessage.includes('permission')) {
    throw new Error('Amber permission denied. Check app permissions in Amber settings.');
  }

  // Amber crashed
  if (errorMessage.includes('crash') || errorMessage.includes('stopped')) {
    throw new Error('Amber app crashed. Please restart Amber and try again.');
  }

  throw new Error(`Amber signing failed: ${errorMessage}`);
}
```

**Testing:**
- ✅ Reject request in Amber → See helpful message
- ✅ Let request timeout → See timeout message
- ✅ Try without Amber installed → See install guidance

## Architecture Deep Dive

### GlobalNDK Integration Requirements

**Critical Rule:** All Amber signing operations MUST use the GlobalNDK instance, not create new NDK instances.

**Why GlobalNDK?**
- **Connection Efficiency**: Before GlobalNDK, 9 services × 4 relays = 36 WebSocket connections. After: 1 NDK × 4 relays = 4 connections (90% reduction)
- **Signer Consistency**: Single place to set `ndk.signer` for entire app
- **Timing Issues**: New relay managers need 2-3 seconds to connect
- **Performance**: Reusing one connection pool instead of creating/destroying

**Correct Pattern:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Use GlobalNDK
import { GlobalNDKService } from '../services/nostr/GlobalNDKService';

const ndk = await GlobalNDKService.getInstance();
// ndk.signer is already set to AmberNDKSigner
const event = new NDKEvent(ndk, eventData);
await event.publish();
```

**Anti-Pattern:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Creates new NDK without signer
import { NostrRelayManager } from '../services/nostr/NostrRelayManager';

const relayManager = new NostrRelayManager(); // New NDK, no signer!
await relayManager.publishEvent(event); // Fails for Amber users
```

### UnifiedSigningService Role

The `UnifiedSigningService` is the central hub for all signing operations:

1. **Detects Authentication Method**: Determines if user is using nsec or Amber
2. **Creates Appropriate Signer**:
   - nsec → `NDKPrivateKeySigner`
   - Amber → `AmberNDKSigner`
3. **Sets Signer on GlobalNDK**: Critical step for Amber users
4. **Provides Signing Interface**: `signEvent()` works for both auth methods
5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Amber-specific error messages

**Services should use UnifiedSigningService, NOT create signers directly.**

## Comprehensive Audit Results (January 2025)

A full audit of Amber integration identified 10 issues across 4 severity levels:

### Critical Issues (Fixed ✅)
1. **joinRequestPublisher creates own NDK** → Fixed: Use GlobalNDK (Commit 3faead6)
2. **NostrProtocolHandler uses nostr-tools** → Fixed: Use NDK + dynamic imports (Commit 3faead6)

### High Priority Issues (Fixed ✅)
3. **AmberNDKSigner uses nostr-tools nip19** → Fixed: Use NDK's nip19 (Commit 3faead6)
4. **No timeout for Amber prompts** → Fixed: 60s timeout (Commit 3faead6)
5. **No Amber not installed detection** → Fixed: Helpful error (Commit 3faead6)
6. **Missing Amber error messages** → Fixed: Enhanced errors (Commit 3faead6)

### Medium Priority Issues (Remaining)
7. **WalletSync overwrites GlobalNDK signer** → Could cause race conditions
8. **No loading state for Amber operations** → Users think app froze
9. **blockUntilReady() naming confusion** → Minor clarity issue

### Low Priority Issues (Tech Debt)
10. **30+ files still use nostr-tools** → Long-term migration needed

**Commits:**
- `248e2d5`: Set Amber/nsec signer on GlobalNDK
- `3faead6`: Fix join requests, crypto conflicts, timeouts, error handling

## Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: "Amber doesn't pull up when signing"

**Symptoms:**
- Error message appears immediately
- Amber app never opens
- Login works fine

**Diagnosis:**
Check if signer is set on GlobalNDK:
```typescript
const ndk = await GlobalNDKService.getInstance();
console.log('Signer set?', !!ndk.signer); // Should be true
```

**Solution:**
- Ensure `UnifiedSigningService.getSigner()` is called after login
- Verify `ndk.signer = signer` is executed
- Check console logs for "✅ UnifiedSigningService: Set AmberNDKSigner on GlobalNDK"

---

### Error: "Cannot initialize crypto module"

**Symptoms:**
- Random crypto errors during signing
- Intermittent failures
- Works sometimes, fails other times

**Diagnosis:**
Check for nostr-tools imports:
```bash
grep -r "from 'nostr-tools'" src/
```

**Solution:**
- Replace with NDK equivalents:
  - `nip19` → Import from `@nostr-dev-kit/ndk`
  - `finalizeEvent`, `verifyEvent` → Dynamic imports only when needed
- Never import nostr-tools at top level alongside NDK

---

### Error: "Amber request timed out after 60 seconds"

**Symptoms:**
- User opens Amber but doesn't approve
- App waits 60 seconds
- Timeout error appears

**Diagnosis:**
Working as intended! Timeout prevents indefinite hangs.

**Solution:**
- User should retry and respond promptly in Amber
- Consider increasing timeout if 60s isn't enough
- Timeout configured in `AmberNDKSigner.AMBER_TIMEOUT_MS`

---

### Error: "Amber app not found. Please install Amber..."

**Symptoms:**
- Error message with Play Store link
- Happens when Amber not installed

**Diagnosis:**
Working as intended! Helpful error for users without Amber.

**Solution:**
- User needs to install Amber from Play Store
- Link provided in error message: `com.greenart7c3.nostrsigner`
- After install, retry login/signing

---

### Error: "Signing request rejected in Amber"

**Symptoms:**
- User explicitly denies request in Amber
- Error message explains rejection

**Diagnosis:**
Working as intended! User chose to cancel.

**Solution:**
- User should retry and approve in Amber
- Check if request looks suspicious (wrong app, unexpected event)
- Verify user intended to sign this event

- [ ] **Rejection Test**: Trigger signing, open Amber, deny request, verify rejection error
- [ ] **No Amber Test**: Uninstall Amber, try to sign, verify helpful error with Play Store link

### Expected Console Logs
```
✅ UnifiedSigningService: Created AmberNDKSigner and set on GlobalNDK
[Amber] Signing event kind 1301 via Activity Result
✅ Signed event with NDKSigner: abc123... (kind 1301)
📤 Publishing join request for team: RUNSTR (attempt 1/3)
✅ Join request published successfully on attempt 1: xyz789...
```

### Common Issues During Testing
- **Amber doesn't open**: Check if signer set on GlobalNDK
- **Crypto errors**: Check for nostr-tools imports
- **App hangs**: Timeout should trigger after 60s
- **Generic errors**: Check `UnifiedSigningService` error handling

---

## Remaining Work (Medium/Low Priority)

### Medium Priority
1. **Fix WalletSync GlobalNDK Signer Override**
   - Currently overwrites `ndk.signer` unconditionally
   - Should check if signer already exists
   - Low risk but could cause race conditions

2. **Add Loading States for Amber Operations**
   - Show "Waiting for Amber approval..." message
   - Prevents users thinking app is frozen
   - Affects workout posting, social posts, join requests

3. **Rename blockUntilReady() Method**
   - Current name implies blocking/waiting
   - Behavior is instant if pubkey cached
   - Consider `initialize()` or add clarifying comment

### Low Priority (Tech Debt)
4. **Migrate All nostr-tools Usage to NDK**
   - 30+ files still import from nostr-tools
   - Create migration task
   - Add ESLint rule to prevent future nostr-tools imports
   - Most critical: `utils/nostr.ts`, `utils/teamUtils.ts`
