# ‚ö° RUNSTR

**Bitcoin-powered fitness competitions on Nostr protocol**

The first fitness competition platform that combines the decentralized power of Nostr with real Bitcoin rewards through the Lightning Network. Built entirely on the Nostr protocol, every workout, team membership, and competition exists as permanent, user-owned data that no company can delete or monetize without your permission.

## üåü Breaking Free from Digital Fitness Silos

**The Problem: Digital Silos at War**
The current fitness app landscape is fragmented into digital silos - Nike Run Club, Strava, Apple Fitness, Garmin Connect - each fighting for user retention through proprietary ecosystems. These platforms offer in-app challenges, events, levels, friends lists, and workout histories, but they're black boxes for your data with little to no monetary incentive to participate. Users are forced to choose between platforms, losing their community, history, and progress if they switch. RUNSTR breaks down these walls by creating an interoperable fitness layer on top of existing apps - you can run with Nike Run Club and still participate in Bitcoin-earning competitions, eliminating switching costs while adding real financial rewards to your existing fitness routine.

**The Solution: Nostr-Native Fitness Protocol**
RUNSTR is pioneering a new category of Nostr client - the fitness client - that transforms isolated workout data into a unified, portable, and monetizable fitness identity. By leveraging Nostr's decentralized protocol, RUNSTR enables users to login with their Nostr identity (nsec), save all workouts locally, and selectively publish to Nostr's social feeds (Kind 1 events) or competitive workout records (Kind 1301). This approach won first place in the NosFabrica challenge, validating the concept of bringing health and fitness to the decentralized web. Users maintain complete ownership of their data while gaining the ability to earn Bitcoin from any workout, regardless of which app they use to track it.

**P2P Bitcoin Fitness Economy**
RUNSTR TEAMS empowers peer-to-peer fitness communities where every member has an auto-created Lightning wallet (via NIP-60/61 protocol), enabling instant Bitcoin transactions within teams. Captains create teams and host competitions with entry fees that build prize pools, automatically distributed to winners via Lightning payments. Team pages feature integrated commerce through shop buttons linking to Shopstr, charity zap buttons for captain-selected causes, and subscription models for exclusive competitions. This creates circular Bitcoin economies within fitness teams - members support each other with zaps, pay entry fees for competitions, win prizes, and reinvest in team merchandise and events.

**Captain-Led Community Empowerment**
Team captains become fitness entrepreneurs with tools to build and monetize their communities. Through wizard-driven competition creation, captains set parameters for leagues, events, and challenges across seven activity types (running, walking, cycling, hiking, swimming, rowing, strength training). The system aggregates workouts from Apple Health, Garmin, and Google Fit, allowing members to cross-post from their preferred apps while participating in Nostr-based competitions. Captains can distribute prizes directly via Lightning zaps, manage team memberships through Nostr lists (Kind 30000), and build their brand through team-specific merchandise and subscription tiers.

**Vision & Monetization Strategy**
RUNSTR targets fitness enthusiasts within the Bitcoin ecosystem - a demographic that spends significant amounts on fitness annually and values data sovereignty. As an additive experience sitting on top of existing fitness stacks, RUNSTR provides earning potential without disrupting current routines. RUNSTR LLC monetizes by operating as a team within the platform, competing on equal footing with users by selling subscriptions, event tickets, and merchandise through the app. The company focuses on implementing gamification strategies to promote high sats flow within the ecosystem, taking small transaction fees while fostering a sustainable P2P fitness economy. Available on iOS and ZapStore, RUNSTR is building the foundation for a global, interoperable fitness ecosystem where dedication to health translates directly into Bitcoin earnings.
